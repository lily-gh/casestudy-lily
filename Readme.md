# Case Study - Enterprise All Inclusive

## Steps to run the program locally with Docker
1. clone this repository
2. from the repository folder, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
    ```
    This should create and start a docker container for the database and one for the app itself, which should be running on port `8080`:

3. run `docker-compose down` when you want to stop and remove the docker containers.


## Entity Relationship Diagram
These are the entities used in the app:
![Entity Relationship Diagram](img/er-diagram.png)

Since multiple tenants might use the same customer number in their external systems, we call the customer number `external_id` on our side, and have our own internal `id` which is automatically generated. This helps us avoid issues when multiple tenants have customers with the same "customer number" on their systems and also help us avoid duplicating both `tenant_id` and `external_id` in related tables.


## API
To easily use the api, open [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and import the included Postman collection file [postman_collection.json](postman_collection.json) to try out the endpoints.


### book money
**`POST tenants/{tenantId}/customers/{customerNumber}/book-money`**

Request params:
 - **tenantId**: the tenant ID as stored in the database.
 - **customerNumber**: the customer number as the tenant sees it on their side (stored as `external_id` on our side).

Request body:
```json
{
    "amount": 37.50 // amount to be booked
}
```

Response body:
```json
{
    "transactionId": 34, // id for the newly created transaction, can be used to void the transaction
    "balance": 1000.00 // updated customer balance
}
```
This API can be used to book positive or negative amounts.


### void transaction
**`PATCH tenants/{tenantId}/customers/{customerNumber}/void-transaction`**

Request params:
 - **tenantId**: the tenant ID as stored in the database.
 - **customerNumber**: the customer number as the tenant sees it on their side (stored as `external_id` on our side).

Request body:
```json
{
    "transactionId": 20 // transaction to be voided
}
```

Response body:
```json
{
    "balance": 1000.00 // updated customer balance after voiding the transaction
}
```


### fetch recent transactions by tenant and customer number
**`GET customercare/tenants/{tenantId}/customers/{customerNumber}/transactions?page={page}}&size={size}`**

Request params:
 - **tenantId**: the tenant ID as stored in the database.
 - **customerNumber**: the customer number as the tenant sees it on their side (stored as `external_id` on our side).
 - **page**: which page to start listing the records from.
 - **size**: size of the page returned.

Response body:
```json
{
    "transactions": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "customerId": 1,
            "amount": 500.00,
            "type": "PAY_IN",
            "createdAt": "2023-12-04T19:12:11.571908",
            "updatedAt": null
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "customerId": 1,
            "amount": 500.00,
            "type": "PAY_IN",
            "createdAt": "2023-12-04T19:12:11.571908",
            "updatedAt": null
        },
        {
            "id": 24,
            "customerId": 1,
            "amount": 37.50,
            "type": "PAY_IN",
            "createdAt": "2023-12-04T19:12:13.94461",
            "updatedAt": null
        }
    ],
    "page": 0,
    "totalElements": 5
}
```


### fetch audit logs
**`GET auditlogs?page={page}}&size={size}`**

Request params:
 - **page**: which page to start listing the records from.
 - **size**: size of the page returned.

Response body:
```json
{
    "auditLogs": [
        {
            "id": 4,
            "type": "TRANSACTION_VOIDED",
            "tenantId": 1,
            "externalId": 100,
            "customerId": 1,
            "transactionId": 29,
            "remoteAddress": "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1",
            "createdAt": "2023-12-04T11:32:58.323794"
        },
        {
            "id": 5,
            "type": "MONEY_BOOKING",
            "tenantId": 1,
            "externalId": 101,
            "customerId": 2,
            "transactionId": 30,
            "remoteAddress": "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1",
            "createdAt": "2023-12-04T11:34:02.183356"
        },
        {
            "id": 6,
            "type": "MONEY_BOOKING",
            "tenantId": 1,
            "externalId": 101,
            "customerId": 2,
            "transactionId": 31,
            "remoteAddress": "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1",
            "createdAt": "2023-12-04T11:34:03.898067"
        }
    ],
    "page": 1,
    "totalElements": 11
}
```

Every successful call to **book money** and **void transaction** endpoints generate an entry in the `audit_log` table.


## Seed data
Some seed data is already available for use with the app:

_Note: some columns have been omitted (e.g. `created_at`, `updated_at`)_

## Notes and improvement ideas ðŸ’¡
 - Sequential IDs have been used as the primary keys for the tables to make it simpler to visualize and play around with in Postman, on a production environment I would opt for using [UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) instead, as they prevent malicious users from guessing the IDs and abusing the API.

 - Secure endpoints with authentication (e.g. JWT token). With added security, it would be possible to also populate the `audit_log` table with user data such as email and username instead of only the request parameters and user's remote address. _(I might still try to add JWT authentication through the week)_

 - Additional validation when voiding transactions. E.g.: "only transactions created on the past _X_ days can be voided".

 ## Accessing postgres directly
 To access the psql console directly, first find out what is the **container id** for the database with `docker ps`:
 ```bash
docker ps                                    î‚² KILL âœ˜ î‚² 13m 41s ï‰’ î‚² 9.72G ïƒ¤ î‚°
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                            NAMES
ff97206fe32e   accountbalanceservice-app   "/__cacert_entrypoinâ€¦"   46 seconds ago   Up 46 seconds   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   accountbalanceservice-app-1
d811c75f8a03   postgres:16.1               "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   46 seconds ago   Up 46 seconds   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp                           accountbalanceservice-database-1
 ```

In this case the database **container id** is `d811c75f8a03`. Next, run the following commands to connect to the container and run `psql`:
```bash
docker exec -it d811c75f8a03 bash
su postgres
psql
```
This should connect you to the running database instance and allow you to run posgres commands directly into the Posgres instance inside the container.
